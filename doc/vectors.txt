	vector - geometric vector library
	Copyright (C) 2018 Jeffery R. Marshall (coder[at]execulink[dot]com)

vectors library 
===============

	A general purpose geometric vector library.  Started around
	2006, and uses (at the time) overloaded operators to create
	a data type that can be used in expressions.

	vector2 - 2D vector data type
	vector3 - 3D vector data type

	Also has some other support functions and constants

	Worst thing I ever done was to copy and paste this library
	code where it was needed.  The result was dozens of copies
	of the same source that were all slightly mutated.  One of
	the purposes of this library is to consolidate my many
	versions.

Notation
--------

	The following will be used:

	(x, y)     2D vector with scalar components x & y
	(x, y, z)  3D vector with scalar components x, y, z
	{a}        vector 'a', what would normally be written in bold
	           or with a arrow line above
	a.x        x component of {a}, a subscript x
	a.y        y component of {a}, a subscript y
	a.z        z component of {a}, a subscript z


Vectors API
===========

	2D vectors - see vectors_vector2.txt
	3D vectors - see vectors_vector3.txt


vectors namespace
-----------------
	All vectors library functions and types exist in the
	vectors namespace


version
-------

	#define VECTORS_VERSION_MAJOR 0
	#define VECTORS_VERSION_MINOR 2


type REAL
---------
	
	The "real" type resolves to single float if not already defined.

	
	#ifndef (real)
		type real as single
	#endif

	See vectypes.bi


NULL
----

	If not defined, will be defined

	#define NULL 0

	See vectypes.bi


FALSE, TRUE
-----------

	The False and True values.  Will be defined if not already
	defined by the compiler.  Usage predates the inclusion of
	True, and False, intrinsic boolean definitions.

	See vectypes.bi


Boolean, BOOL
-------------

	If Boolean not defined, will be defined to unsigned 
	integer type

	#ifndef (boolean)
		type boolean as unisigned integer
	#endif
	
	If BOOL not defined will be defined to boolean type

	#ifndef (BOOL)
		type BOOL as boolean
	#endif

	See vectypes.bi


FixAngle180( angle )
--------------------

	declare function FixAngle180( byval angle as real ) as real

	Computes equivalent angle between -180 degrees and 180 degrees.

	Uses a simple loop to clamp the angle, so expectation is that
	the starting angle is somewhat close to the -180 to 180 range to
	begin with.

	Returns the clamped angle.

	See vectypes.bi


FixAngle360( angle )
--------------------

	declare function FixAngle360( byval angle as real ) as real

	Computes equivalent angle between 0 degrees and 360 degrees.

	Uses a simple loop to clamp the angle, so expectation is that
	the starting angle is somewhat close to the 0 to 360 range to
	begin with.

	Returns the clamped angle.

	See vectypes.bi


FixAnglePI( angle )
--------------------

	declare function FixAnglePI( byval angle as real ) as real

	Computes equivalent angle between -PI radians and PI radians.

	Uses a simple loop to clamp the angle, so expectation is that
	the starting angle is somewhat close to the -PI to PI range to
	begin with.

	Returns the clamped angle.

	See vectypes.bi


FixAnglePI2( angle )
--------------------

	declare function FixAnglePI2( byval angle as real ) as real

	Computes equivalent angle between 0 radians and 2*PI radians

	Uses a simple loop to clamp the angle, so expectation is that
	the starting angle is somewhat close to the 0 to 2*PI range to
	begin with.

	Returns the clamped angle.

	See vectypes.bi
