vector
======

	A very basic 2D vector api using one type (structure) and 
	procedures only.  This one dates from 2006 and was imported 
	from a similar looking library written in both QB and C.  
	Because procedures only	only are used, code was failrly
	simple to translate between QB and C.  (note: while this
	is the original file name used, should probably rename it
	so it is noticably different from the overall project.)

Notation
--------

	There are several ways to represent vectors, none of which
	fully translate to plain text, so for this document, the 
	following will be used:

	(x, y)  vector with scalar components x & y
	{a}     vector 'a', what would normally be written in bold
	        or with a arrow line above
	a.x     x component of {a}, a subscript x
	a.y     y component of {b}, a subscript y
	{a, b}  a line segment from {a} to {b}
