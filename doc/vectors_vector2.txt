vector2
=======

type vector2
------------

	type vector2
		union
			type
				x as real
				y as real
			end type
			e(0 to 1) as real
		end union
	end type

	Vector components can be access through either the named
	fields x and y.  Or through the element array e().


Construction
------------

	Create a vector

		dim {v}

	vector data type uses a default and built-in contructor.
	When the variable is defined, components default to zero
	values.
		v.x = 0
		v.y = 0

	Example:
		#include "vector2.bi"
		using vectors
		dim v as vector2
		print v

	Output:
		(0, 0)


Initialization
--------------

		dim {v} = (x, y)

	Set a vector {v} to component values (x, y) when declaring
	the variable:
		v.x = x
		v.y = y

	Example:
		#include "vector2.bi"
		using vectors
		dim v as vector2 = (1, 2)
		print v

	Output:
		(1, 2)


{v}.Set( x, y )
---------------

	Set vector components

		{v} = (x, y)

	Set a vector {v} to component values (x, y)

	Example:
		#include "vector2.bi"
		using vectors
		dim v as vector2
		v.set( 1, 2)

		(1, 2)


Operator let ( vector2 )
------------------------

	Assignment operator '='

		{v} = {a}
