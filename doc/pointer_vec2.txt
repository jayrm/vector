pointer_vec2
============

	A 2D vector API using one type (structure) and  procedures 
	only.  All vector arguments are passed by-value by-pointer,
	and scalars are passed by value.  This API dates from later
	on in 2006 and was adapted from the simple 2D vector API.
	Was only every used for one (never published) project.


Notation
--------

	The following will be used:

	(x, y)  vector with scalar components x & y
	{a}     vector 'a', what would normally be written in bold
	        or with a arrow line above
	a.x     x component of {a}, a subscript x
	a.y     y component of {a}, a subscript y
