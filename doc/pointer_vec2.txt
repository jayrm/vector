============

	Simple 2D vector API using procedures only

	A very basic 2D vector api using one type (structure) and 
	procedures only.  This one dates from 2006 and was imported 
	from a similar looking library written in both QB and C.  
	Because procedures only	only are used, code was failrly
	simple to translate between QB and C.  The original C version
	was for a compiler that did not support inline functions, 
	so writing an API in this still would allow easy substitution 
	for macros; an alternative to inline functions.

	Original filenames were vector.bi and vector.bas and
	no namespace added.

	A 2D vector API using one type (structure) and procedures 
	only.  All vector arguments are passed by pointer to vector,
	and scalars are passed by value.  This API dates from later
	on in 2006 and was adapted from the simple 2D vector API.
	Was only every used for one (never published) project.

Vector API
==========

Notation
--------

	The following will be used:

	(x, y)  vector with scalar components x & y
	{a}     vector 'a', what would normally be written in bold
	        or with a arrow line above
	a.x     x component of {a}, a subscript x
	a.y     y component of {a}, a subscript y


type real
---------
	
	The "real" type resolves to single or double precision float.
	By default,	if not defined, real will be typed to single.

	#ifndef real
		type real as single
	#endif
