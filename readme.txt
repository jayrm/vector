simple vector

	Simple 2D vector API using procedures only

	A very basic 2D vector api using one type (structure) and 
	procedures only.  This one dates from 2006 and was imported 
	from a similar looking library written in both QB and C.  
	Because procedures only	only are used, code was failrly
	simple to translate between QB and C.

simple vector3

	Simple 3D vector API using procedures only

	A very basic 3D vector api using one type (structure) and 
	procedures only adapted from the Simple 2D vector api.
