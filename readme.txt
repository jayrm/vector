vector

	Simple 2D vector API using procedures only

	A very basic 2D vector api using one type (structure) and 
	procedures only.  This one dates from 2006 and was imported 
	from a similar looking library written in both QB and C.  
	Because procedures only	only are used, code was failrly
	simple to translate between QB and C.  (note: while this
	is the original file name used, should probably rename it
	so it is noticably different from the overall project.)
